## About Pollora

Pollora bridges the gap between Laravel and WordPress, combining the power and flexibility of Laravel with the user-friendliness and robust content capabilities of WordPress. We believe in providing the best of both worlds, allowing developers to create rich applications, leveraging features from both platforms, such as:


- Laravel's [Expressive routing](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent) with [Corcel](https://github.com/corcel/corcel) models out of the box,
- Configuration-based methods so you can register your custom post types and taxonomies directly from `config/post-types.php` and `config/taxonomy.php`. You can also use the PostType and Taxonomy fluent classes,
- Multi-theme support (with parent and child theme),
- Similarly, for theme setup, handle the registration and configuration of menus, sidebars, and theme supports within `themes/{your-theme}/config/`,
- Unified [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) management,
- Hook (anytime, anywhere !) and Hookable classes (provided by the great [Themosis framework](https://framework.themosis.com)),
- Blade directive designed for WordPress provided by the awesome [Sage Directives](https://log1x.github.io/sage-directives-docs/) package,
- Easy Gutenberg pattern management,
- Seamless [database migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations),
- And much more...

Pollora is designed to be versatile, intuitive, and the perfect tool for projects that demand the strengths of both Laravel and WordPress.
